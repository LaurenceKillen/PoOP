# 💩 PoOP – Proof of Origin Protocol
A digital watermarking solution for the generative AI age

## Overview
PoOP (Proof of Origin Protocol) is an **open-source, opt-in authenticity standard** for digital content.  
Its mission is simple: **make it easy for anyone to verify whether a piece of content really came from the claimed creator**.

In an era where AI-generated media is rapidly becoming indistinguishable from reality, PoOP uses cryptographic signatures and decentralized registries to embed **proof-of-origin tokens** into digital files.  
If you see the 💩 badge, you know *who dropped it*.

---

## Why PoOP?
- **AI Deepfakes & Misinformation** are exploding
- **Source verification** is becoming impossible without technical tools
- **Existing trust signals** (blue ticks, verified accounts) are siloed and don’t apply to standalone media
- **Anyone can fake anything** — PoOP is a *free, open, public* way to fight back

---

## How It Works
1. **Creator registers** with PoOP and generates a unique cryptographic keypair
2. **Content is hashed** (image, video, text, audio, PDF, etc.)
3. **Hash is signed** with creator's private key
4. **Signature & metadata** are stored on a public blockchain / hashgraph
5. **PoOP badge & metadata** embedded in the file itself or accessible via API
6. **Verification plugins** for browsers, media players, and CMS platforms check the signature against the blockchain

---

## Scope
PoOP is designed to work with:
- 📸 Images
- 🎥 Video
- 📝 Text & Documents
- 🎙 Audio

---

## Related & Existing Initiatives
We aim to **interoperate, not reinvent**. PoOP will explore integration with:
- [C2PA / Content Authenticity Initiative](https://c2pa.org/)
- [Open Origins](https://openorigins.com/)
- Other open verification standards

---

## Goals
- ✅ Open source & community-driven
- ✅ No central authority
- ✅ Easy to implement (API + browser/plugin support)
- ✅ Opt-in — not mandatory
- ✅ Works for individuals *and* large orgs

## License
We recommend a **permissive open-source license** (MIT, Apache 2.0, or similar) to allow anyone to use, adapt, and build upon PoOP. This is about **protecting truth**, not locking it down.
